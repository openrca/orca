    Root Cause Analysis for Kubernetes
</h2>

OpenRCA attempts to facilitate root cause inference of issues emerging in Kubernetes clusters. By
constructing a real-time cluster topology graph enriched with telemetry data obtained from
integrated telemetry sources (Prometheus, Elasticsearch, Falco, Istio, and others), provides
operators with a powerful analytical toolkit for dealing with daily application failures,
bottlenecks, and misconfigurations. Moreover, it comes with algorithms that leverage the collected
graph data to pinpoint sources of complex cluster defects.

## Objectives

- Real-time cluster topology visualization
- Integration hub for telemetry data (Prometheus, Elasticsearch,
  Falco, Istio, and others)
- Post-mortem analysis
- Automated root cause inference
- Diagnostics framework for common applications (databases, load
  balancers, message queues)
- Site reliability engineering and chaos testing
